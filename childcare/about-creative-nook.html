                Creative Nook aims to provide a warm, caring, and safe
                environment where all children can thrive, feel safe, secure,

                We believe that a holistic approach with a strong
                focus on imagination, creativity and freedom of choice will

                Meals :
                  Creative Nook has partnered with KGF (Kids Gourmet Food).  
                  Since 2002, KGF is providing fresh, nutritional and home cooked meals 
                  for children to build positive eating habits. 
                  They believe that 
                  early exposure to a variety of nutritious meals is essential for the development of long-term healthy eating habits. 
                  The 6 weeks menu provides a variety of cultural food for
                  children to taste and explore. The meals are prepared 
                  keeping Australin Health Guidelines in mind.
