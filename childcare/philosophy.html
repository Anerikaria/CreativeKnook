              Creative Nook aims to provide a warm, caring, and safe environment
              where all children can thrive, feel safe, secure, and supported.
              We believe that a holistic approach with a strong focus on
              imagination, creativity and freedom of choice will support
              children to develop their self-esteem, passion for learning and
              understanding of the world they live in. We believe that children
              have rights, and it plays a fundamental role in how we interact,
              educate and care for children. We aim to celebrate and embrace the
              uniqueness and diversity of all children, helping them find their
              voice and discover their sense of being, belonging and becoming in
              our community and wider world.

              Families and Communities
            </h5>
            <p>
              We believe in creating a strong sense of belonging by working
              collaboratively and establishing a warm and meaningful
              relationship with families and the broader community. We believe
              that families are the most important teacher in the child’s life.
              Therefore, it is essential to form a vital link between families,
              the home environment, community, and our service. Our service will
              strive to become an extension of each family’s differences and
              individuality. This will make our service a diverse, positive, and
              unique learning community. We respect the land on which our
              service stands and their past, present, and future custodians. Our
              Service will strive to build strong relationships with our local
              community and will share their vison of equal opportunities,
              sustainable living, and respect for cultural diversity.

            <h5 class="features__header aligncenter">Educators</h5>
            <p>
              Our educators share a vision of holistic approach and are
              committed in developing a long-lasting relationship with children,
              their families and community. All educators strive to provide
              equal, inclusive, and non-biased educational opportunities to all
              children. The educators will work collaboratively to self-improve
              through reflective practice. The educators will be provided with
               opportunities to professionally develop their skills for better
              advancement. All educators will be committed to providing current,
              forward thinking and research-based practice for all our children.
              We believe in being innovative, creative, and fostering children’s
              knowledge through ongoing research. Our educators are passionate and 
              plays essential role in supporting children’s desire to explore and 
              experiment through variety of activities. Our dedicated educators and educational
              leaders are trusted, valued and have open communication. This
              promotes positive, professional, and ethical work culture. Our
              leaders and educators welcome National Quality Framework through
              the implementation and the assessment/rating process and we
              embrace the challenges and higher benchmark established through
              the National Quality Standards. We strive for excellence in
              providing education and care services to our children and
              families.

            <h5 class="features__header aligncenter">Curriculum</h5>
            <p>
              Our Curriculum reflects Steiner’s approach to early childhood
              education. Our curriculum is unique as it  allows the children to 
              engage in play based learning through self initiated approach using 
              various simple play materials. Our educators create a loving and warm
              atmosphere that provides the optimal opportunities for children to
              engage in real activities like gardening, cooking, physical play,
              risk taking, problem solving, imaginative and creative play. The
              Curriculum focuses on children’s social, emotional, and physical
              wellbeing prior to literacy and numeracy development. As we
              believe that if children are self-confident, they easily learn
              academic concepts. Our curriculum includes intentional and
              unplanned learning experiences, routines and transitions which
              will allow the children to achieve Outcomes from Early Years
              Learning Frameworks (EYLF). Our School Readiness Program is unique
              to our setting. The children learn to value education, turn taking
              and fair play while also developing their independence and vital
              skills essential for their role in the wider community.

            <h5 class="features__header aligncenter">Environment</h5>
            <p>
              Environment is an important aspect of children’s education. We
              create an inclusive, stimulating, and open-ended environment for
              all children. Our environment promotes collaborative play,
              solitary play, and hands on experimental play. Children’s physical
              wellbeing is strongly valued, and we encourage our educators and
              families to develop positive attitudes towards exercise,
              nutrition, and healthy lifestyles. The children are encouraged to
              engage in a variety of planned and unplanned physical play
              throughout the day. The children are encouraged to respect natural
              and manmade environment and care of our natural world. At Creative
              Nook, the children will become caretakers, risk takers and will
              become more aware of the world they live in. Our Service strives
              to become environmentally sustainable and embed environmentally
              responsible practice into our daily routine and curriculum.
