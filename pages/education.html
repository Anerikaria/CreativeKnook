                At this age, children are becoming more active in the learning process. They absorb new skills faster and begin to analyze the world around questioning. <br/><br/>
                Our patience and caring educators understand this and allows the children to ask questions and plan activities through discussions and collaboration.<br/> <br/>
                Our program is created using the Steiner’s approach to teaching. The children focus on creative play, imaginative education and experimental learning that leads to developing valuable literacy, numeracy and academic skills.  A variety of open-ended materials are provided to children in the classroom to support their curiosity and learning disposition. <br/><br/>

              readiness curriculum supports children to develop very important
              skills like independence, problem solving, turn taking and asking
              for help when needed. These essential skills are developed through
              a variety of learning experiences that are hands on, interactive,
              imaginative, and challenging for children. Our learning
              experiences will allow your children to develop passion for
              learning so when they go to big school, they will thrive and
