                    <p class="forsomepara">I have over 16 years’ experience working in the childcare industry.
                    In 2008, I began my journey as a primary school teacher.
                    I have been working as a leader for over 10 years now. I was always 
                    encouraged by my parents to make hard choices and take decisions
                     that benefit everyone.I was taught to respect others value, personapties and cultures
                    and accept the people for who they are.</p><br/>
      
                   <p class="forsomepara">This has allowed
                    me to understand the importance of community and families in 
                    children’s lives. I believe that families and community are essential part of children’s education.</p>
                    <br/>
                   <p class="forsomepara">We have created a space that is safe, creative , sustainable and inclusive for all children and their families.
                     I believe that families are a core foundation of any 
                    service and gaining their trust and establishing a connection 
                    with them will allow us to create the best possible
                     educational environment for all the children in our care.</p>
                     <br/>
                   <p class="forsomepara">I also strive to become a positive role model by mentoring staff in all 
                    possible ways to make sure that they enjoy working at Creative Nook Early
                     Learning Centre.

              Creative Nook, has given me many opportunities.
               Allowing me to grow as an educator, learn more in a practical setting and gain more. The centre has a welcoming atmosphere and make coming to work enjoyable! The best part of my job, is being able to teach concepts and have children use their new knowledge for other aspects of life. Whether with family, they’re friends or transitioning to primary school.

                It is such a pleasure working with all the families at Creative Nook, as it has such a lovely community feel and it’s great every morning seeing all the families that have been here for some time and now returning with their siblings. I enjoy providing the children with a great first start to their education.
